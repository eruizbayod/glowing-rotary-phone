PROJECT 1

For this artwork I took the inspiration from Bridget Riley, whose artworks were form with colourful shapes displayed on a canvas. She has produced different artworks, but I picked some of them that have similar structures such as: 

-	Shadow Play (https://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w944h944/collection/CAM/CCF/CAM_CCF_PD_56_1996-001.jpg)

-	Shadow Rhythm (https://media.mutualart.com/Images/2011_06/19/03/035552277/d8795bd0-3c02-4f0f-a797-01ca2ab7ee75_570.Jpeg)


-	Nataraja (https://en.artsdot.com/ADC/Art.nsf/O/AQSCRN/$File/Bridget-Riley-Nataraja.jpg).

The artwork has been produced using vector graphics to recreate the rhomboid figures present all over the canvas, using a nested loop that creates using beginShape and endShape all the figures by columns, each one of them is filled with a random colour taken from a colour palette where the colours from Rileyâ€™s artworks are stored. Every time the user presses any key, another artwork is produced by the computer, allowing the user to get a new artwork displayed.
